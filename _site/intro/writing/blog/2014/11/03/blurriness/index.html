        <p>My own personal break has concluded, signaling my ascent into the academic school year. Many of us experience relief, as probing, yet stock questions concerning the fall quarter come to a close. Others, revel in the social opportunities that await. And still others dread the advent of a fresh round of classes and over-eager professors.</p>

<p>College. The ephemeral journey into adulthood. A short, or not so short, 4 years dedicated to growth, learning, revelry, brotherhood, carnal pursuits, and “getting a job”.</p>

<p>3 months of eye-opening, uncomfortable, awkward, exhausting, exciting, and invigorating experiences that passed in a eternal blink of the eye. In hindsight, the first quarterexists in such a molding way that I am nearly incapable of recalling it.</p>

<p>The blur of life renders the full scope inscrutable. I gape at the speed with which entire months gallop into the past. Consider the gravity which a day holds. The day is momentous because of it’s banality.</p>

<p>As students, our senses become deadened by routine. We live for the weekends and time away from schoolwork. The days pass in a prosaic blur, the journey into adulthood. Soon, adulthood loses its’ luster and passes in a similar blur.</p>

<p>I long to embrace the uncomfortable. Revel in time spent with friends. And dispel overt worry from my life. But is that really enough? Time will tell.</p>

<p>And maybe, just maybe, the blur will slow down.</p>
