My own personal break has concluded, signaling my ascent into the academic school year. Many of us experience relief, as probing, yet stock questions concerning the fall quarter come to a close. Others, revel in the social opportunities that await. And still others dread the advent of a fresh round of classes and over-eager professors.

College. The ephemeral journey into adulthood. A short, or not so short, 4 years dedicated to growth, learning, revelry, brotherhood, carnal pursuits, and “getting a job”.

3 months of eye-opening, uncomfortable, awkward, exhausting, exciting, and invigorating experiences that passed in a eternal blink of the eye. In hindsight, the first quarterexists in such a molding way that I am nearly incapable of recalling it.

The blur of life renders the full scope inscrutable. I gape at the speed with which entire months gallop into the past. Consider the gravity which a day holds. The day is momentous because of it’s banality.

As students, our senses become deadened by routine. We live for the weekends and time away from schoolwork. The days pass in a prosaic blur, the journey into adulthood. Soon, adulthood loses its’ luster and passes in a similar blur.

I long to embrace the uncomfortable. Revel in time spent with friends. And dispel overt worry from my life. But is that really enough? Time will tell.

And maybe, just maybe, the blur will slow down.
